# Raspberry Pi Home Lab — Tailscale Serve Setup
#
# What this does:
#   Maps each local service to a port on your Tailscale HTTPS
#   hostname so you can access them from any device logged into
#   your Tailscale account, from anywhere, without port numbers
#   in the URL.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Tailscale already installed and logged in (tailscale up)
#   - HTTPS certificates enabled in Tailscale admin dashboard:
#     login.tailscale.com → DNS → Enable HTTPS Certificates
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x tailscale-serve.sh
#   sudo ./tailscale-serve.sh
#
# After running, your services will be at:
#   https://<your-pi-hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net        → Homepage
#   https://<your-pi-hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net:9000   → Portainer
#   https://<your-pi-hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8053   → Pi-hole
#   https://<your-pi-hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net:3001   → Uptime Kuma
#   https://<your-pi-hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8080   → Dozzle
#   https://<your-pi-hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net:19999  → Netdata
#   https://<your-pi-hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8085   → File Browser
#   https://<your-pi-hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net:81     → Nginx Proxy Manager
#
# All of these are private to your Tailscale network only.
# Only devices logged into your Tailscale account can reach them.
