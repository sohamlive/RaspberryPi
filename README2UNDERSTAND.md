# Home Lab — Raspberry Pi 4

A self-hosted home lab running on a Raspberry Pi 4, providing network services, monitoring, file management, remote access, and network printing for all devices in the home.

---

## Network Layout

| Device | IP | Role |
|---|---|---|
| ISP Router | `192.168.1.1` | DHCP server, internet gateway |
| Raspberry Pi | `192.168.1.2` | This device — static IP |
| TP-Link Router | `192.168.1.3` | Personal router in AP/bridge mode (no NAT) |
| Other devices | `192.168.1.x` | All on the same flat subnet |

All devices get IPs from the ISP router's DHCP. The personal router acts as a WiFi access point only — no double NAT.

DNS for all devices is handled by Pi-hole at `192.168.1.2`. Set this in the ISP router's DHCP settings.

## Services

| Service | Local URL | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Homepage | `http://home.lab` | 3000 | Dashboard for all services |
| Pi-hole | `http://pihole.lab/admin` | 8053 | DNS + ad blocking |
| Portainer | `http://portainer.lab` | 9000 | Docker container management |
| Nginx Proxy Manager | `http://proxy.lab` | 81 (admin) | Reverse proxy for *.lab domains |
| Uptime Kuma | `http://uptime.lab` | 3001 | Uptime monitoring & alerts |
| Dozzle | `http://logs.lab` | 8080 | Docker container log viewer |
| Netdata | `http://stats.lab` | 19999 | System stats (CPU, RAM, temp, disk) |
| File Browser | `http://files.lab` | 8085 | Web-based file manager |
| CUPS | `http://192.168.1.2:631` | 631 | Network print server |

---

## Remote Access

**Tailscale** is installed on the Pi as a host service (not Docker). It provides:
- SSH from anywhere: `ssh soham@homepi.darter-economy.ts.net`
- Web UI access via Tailscale IP or hostname + port
- Split DNS: `.lab` domains resolve correctly on any Tailscale-connected device

**Tailscale Serve** maps services to HTTPS URLs on the Tailscale network:

| Service | Tailscale URL |
|---|---|
| Homepage | `https://homepi.darter-economy.ts.net` |
| Portainer | `https://homepi.darter-economy.ts.net:9000` |
| Pi-hole | `https://homepi.darter-economy.ts.net:8053` |
| Uptime Kuma | `https://homepi.darter-economy.ts.net:3001` |
| Dozzle | `https://homepi.darter-economy.ts.net:8080` |
| Netdata | `https://homepi.darter-economy.ts.net:19999` |
| File Browser | `https://homepi.darter-economy.ts.net:8085` |
| CUPS | `https://homepi.darter-economy.ts.net:631` |

---

## Network Printing

An **Epson L3110** is connected to the Pi via USB and shared over the network via CUPS.

| Platform | How to print |
|---|---|
| iPhone / iPad | AirPrint — appears automatically in Print dialog, no setup needed |
| Mac | System Settings → Printers & Scanners → Add — auto-discovered |
| Windows | Settings → Printers & Scanners → Add device — auto-discovered via Samba |
| Android | Install Mopria Print Service → add printer at `192.168.1.2` |

---

## SD Card Protection

**log2ram** is installed to reduce SD card wear. It moves `/var/log` to RAM and syncs to disk once daily. If the Pi loses power unexpectedly, that day's logs may be lost — acceptable trade-off for a home lab.

- Size: 128MB RAM allocated for logs
- Journald capped at 64MB
- Verify after reboot: `sudo systemctl status log2ram`

## Fresh Install — Step by Step

### Before running setup.sh

Edit `docker-compose.yml` and change:
- `FTLCONF_webserver_api_password: "changeme"` → your Pi-hole password

### Run setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/homelab.git
cd homelab
chmod +x setup.sh teardown.sh tailscale-serve.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

### After setup.sh completes — reboot first

```bash
sudo reboot
```

log2ram requires a reboot to activate. SSH back in after ~30 seconds.

## Manual Steps (do these once after first boot)

These cannot be automated and must be done manually.

### 1. Nginx Proxy Manager — configure *.lab routes

Visit `http://192.168.1.2:81`
Default login: `admin@example.com` / `changeme` (change immediately)

Add a proxy host for each service:

| Domain | Forward IP | Forward Port |
|---|---|---|
| `home.lab` | `192.168.1.2` | `3000` |
| `pihole.lab` | `192.168.1.2` | `8053` |
| `portainer.lab` | `192.168.1.2` | `9000` |
| `uptime.lab` | `192.168.1.2` | `3001` |
| `logs.lab` | `192.168.1.2` | `8080` |
| `stats.lab` | `192.168.1.2` | `19999` |
| `files.lab` | `192.168.1.2` | `8085` |
| `proxy.lab` | `192.168.1.2` | `81` |

### 2. ISP router — set DNS to Pi-hole

Log into `http://192.168.1.1` → find DHCP settings → set:
- Primary DNS: `192.168.1.2`
- Secondary DNS: `1.1.1.1` (fallback if Pi goes down)

This makes every device on the network use Pi-hole for DNS automatically.

### 3. Tailscale — install and connect

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
# Visit the URL it prints to authenticate
tailscale ip   # note your Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x)
```

Install Tailscale on your phone and laptop too — log in with the same account.

### 4. Tailscale dashboard — enable HTTPS and Split DNS

Go to [login.tailscale.com](https://login.tailscale.com):

**Enable HTTPS certificates:**
DNS → Enable HTTPS Certificates → Enable

**Enable Split DNS for .lab domains:**
DNS → Nameservers → Add nameserver → Custom
- IP: your Pi's Tailscale IP (`100.x.x.x`)
- Tick: Restrict to domain
- Domain: `lab`
- Save

This makes `.lab` URLs resolve correctly on any Tailscale-connected device, anywhere.

### 5. Tailscale Serve — enable web UI access from anywhere

```bash
chmod +x tailscale-serve.sh
sudo ./tailscale-serve.sh
```

### 6. CUPS — add the Epson L3110 printer

Make sure the printer is plugged into the Pi's USB port, then:

1. Visit `http://192.168.1.2:631`
2. Administration → Add Printer
3. Login with your Pi username and password
4. Select the Epson L3110 from Local Printers
   - If it shows a Connection input instead, paste:
     ```
     usb://EPSON/L3110%20Series?serial=5836484E3131313489&interface=1
     ```
5. Name it `Epson-L3110`, tick **Share This Printer**
6. Select driver: `EPSON-ESC/P-R Printer Driver for Linux`
7. Set default options: A4, Standard quality
8. Administration → Manage Printer → tick **Share**

Test with: Administration → Print Test Page

### 7. File Browser — change default password

Visit `http://192.168.1.2:8085`
Login: `admin` / `admin`
Settings → User Management → change password immediately

### 8. Homepage — update Pi-hole widget key

Edit `~/homelab/homepage/config/services.yaml`:
Replace `YOUR_PIHOLE_PASSWORD_HERE` with your actual Pi-hole password.

Or get a dedicated app password from:
Pi-hole admin → Settings → Web interface/API → Expert mode → Configure app password

### 9. Homepage — add background image

```bash
scp your-image.jpg soham@192.168.1.2:~/homelab/homepage/config/images/background.jpg
```

Homepage picks it up immediately on next browser refresh.

## Day-to-Day Usage

**Start all services** (after teardown or manual stop):
```bash
cd ~/homelab
docker compose up -d
```

**Stop all services:**
```bash
docker compose down
```

**Restart a single service:**
```bash
docker compose restart homepage
```

**Update a service to latest image:**
```bash
docker compose pull homepage
docker compose up -d homepage
```

**Or use Portainer** at `http://portainer.lab` for all of the above without SSH.

**Check log2ram status:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status log2ram
```

**Full teardown (removes everything, keeps Docker and Tailscale):**
```bash
sudo ./teardown.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Homepage shows host validation error | Add the new hostname/IP to `HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `docker-compose.yml` → restart homepage |
| Pi-hole wrong password | Run `docker exec -it pihole pihole setpasswd` |
| CUPS web UI disabled | Run `sudo cupsctl WebInterface=yes && sudo systemctl restart cups` |
| Printer not discovered on network | Run `avahi-browse _ipp._tcp --terminate` — check eth0 shows the printer |
| `.lab` domains not resolving remotely | Check Tailscale Split DNS is set to route `lab` to your Pi's Tailscale IP |
| log2ram not active | Reboot required — `sudo reboot` |
| File Browser won't start | Check `./filebrowser/filebrowser.db` exists (touch it if not) |
| SSH session drops during setup | Expected — static IP change restarts network. Reconnect to `192.168.1.2` |
